This diagram illustrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based cost optimization chatbot architecture for Google Kubernetes Engine, with each component explained below one by one.

GCP Billing API (Data Source)
GCP Billing API serves as the data source by providing detailed cost and usage information from Google Cloud projects, allowing programmatic access to billing data for cost optimization purposes.

Vector Embedding
Billing data from the API is transformed into vector representations using an embedding model. Embeddings capture semantic information, making data suitable for efficient retrieval via vector search.

Vector Database (Knowledge/DB or Base)
The processed vector embeddings are stored in a Vector Database. This enables fast retrieval of relevant data through similarity search during chatbot interactions.

Retriever
The Retriever component takes a user’s query (e.g., about GKE costs or pod utilization) and finds the most relevant context from the database by comparing the query’s embedding with existing data chunks.

LLM (ChatGPT/Gemini AI)
A Large Language Model (LLM) receives the prompt (user question) along with retrieved context from the database. It generates a detailed, context-aware answer for the user, blending information from both its internal knowledge and fresh data.

User Interface
The UI acts as the bridge between user and system, presenting a question to the LLM, displaying the generated answer, and optionally passing commands to an Action Executor module.

Action Executor (Optional)
For advanced workflows, the system may execute automated actions (e.g., resource scaling recommendations, cost controls) based on the chatbot’s suggestions, further optimizing GKE usage.

Cost/Utilization Query Example
For example, when a user asks, “Which pods are underutilized?” the chatbot retrieves relevant data from the vector database, formulates an informed answer with the LLM, and displays it via the interface, supporting cost-saving decisions.

This end-to-end flow ensures that GKE costs are constantly monitored and managed with the help of a smart RAG chatbot, facilitating data-driven optimization within cloud environments.
